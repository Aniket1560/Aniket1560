# <h1 align="center"/> Hi there, I am Aniket  👋

<p align="center"/> I'm passionate Tech Lover. Apart from being an ardent tech enthusiast, I love spending time on design tools and exploring competetive coding. I enjoy tweaking and tinkering with the gadgets I own, and apart from all this, I enjoy spending my time watching content from some of my favorite creators. Playing with new software and apps acts like dopamine for me.
